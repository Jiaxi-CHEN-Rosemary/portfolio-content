        <p>Shanghai Opera, also known as Huju in Chinese, was orginated from Shanghai in the 20th century. Using Shanghainese dialect,
			this is the opera that is closest to Shanghainese people. It features more modern stories in 20th and 21st centuries. There are also
			a few pieces adapted from Amrican movies such as Waterloo Bridge.

		<p>Shanghai Opera is the opera form that I like most. I have sung it since I was in kindergarten,
				and it can still help me when I am struggling with homesickness when I study abroad.
				 Unfortunately, with the requirements to learn mandarin for better nationwide communication, fewer and
				fewer people can speak Shanghainese dialect now, which leads to the decline of the opera. I hope that with my introduction,
				more and more people, including you, can be influenced to know more about this wonderful arts.
