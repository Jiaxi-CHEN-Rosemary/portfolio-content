        <p>Hu Opera/Shanghai Opera, also known as Huju in Chinese, originated in Shanghai in the 20th century. The Shanghai opera is rooted in the folksongs of the Huangpu River area.
			Using the Shanghainese dialect, the Shanghai Opera is the opera that is closest to Shanghainese people. It features more modern stories from 20th and 21st centuries, which is unique
			in Chinese opera in that virtually all dramas in its repertoire today are set in the modern era.
			Huju adopted many elements of movies and dramas in lighting, expression, and stage designs.
			There are also a few pieces adapted from American movies such as Waterloo Bridge.
			Through Huju, people can gain a better knowledge of the life and history of the Shanghainese people.

		<h2>Current Condition</h2>
		<p>Hu Opera is the opera form that I like most. I have sung it since I was in kindergarten,
				and it can still help me when I am struggling with homesickness when I study abroad. Along with Suzhou Pingtan and Yue Opera, they
				are the lullaby music my family used to in my childhood.
				 Unfortunately, with the requirements to learn mandarin for better nationwide communication, fewer and
				fewer people can speak Shanghainese dialect now, which leads to the decline of the opera. I hope that with my introduction,
				more and more people, including you, can be influenced to know more about this wonderful arts.
