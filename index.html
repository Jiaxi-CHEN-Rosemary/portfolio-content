				Tranditional Chinese Opera, known as Xiqu in Chinese, is a form of musical theatre in China with more than 1,000 years
				of history. It is a great form of arts incorporated music, song and dance, martial arts, acrobatics, costume and make-up art, as well as literary art.
				There are over a hundred regional branches of traditional Chinese opera today.
				As an international Chinese student, I want to showcase some opera forms to introduce this great  pearl in my culture.
				For any questions, comments, or inquiries, you can get in touch with me via the form below.

		<h2>More about this site</h2>
		<p>Hello! My name is Rosemary, and I am so excited you're here. I was born in Shanghai, China and spent my 19 years of life at this great city.
			My Mom has a nice voice and is a fan of tranditional Chinese Operas. Therefore, I grew up with her voice and learned to sing multiple of them.
			Chinese Opera has become my lullaby songs and beared so many precious childhood memories of mine. In this portfolio, I would like to
			showcase the three opera forms that I grew up with to you: Peking Opera, Hu Opera, and Yue Opera. If you would like learn more, please contact me via the form below.
