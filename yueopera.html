	<p>Yue Opera is the second most popular opera form in China, also known as Shaoxing Opera. Originating in Shengzhou, Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province in about 1900, Yue Opera emphasizes singing, performing, and staging.
		As Yue opera uses is performed speaking in a variant of Wu, it is most popular in Wu-speaking areas including southern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. Like its performers, Yue opera fans are mainly women, 
		resulting in a disproportionate number of love stories in its repertoire and very little acrobatic fighting. Though sharing many common characteristics, especially in terms of singing, with Hu Opera, Yue Opera features
		classic stories such as The Dream of the Red Chamber, The Peony Pavilion, and The Butterfly Lovers.

			Yue Opera is one of the most popular opera forms in Shanghai, with Suzhou Pingtan and Shanghai Opera among the top at the same time.
			My mom like this opera form the most and has taken me to the theatre several times to enjoy the live when I was kid. She played it at home
			and taught me the melody, became my first series of musical education. Outside of my small family, Yue Opera has influenced and
			inspired many artists from other disciplines to create nultiple vaarious masterpieces. Among them, the most famous
			one is works of orchestral music: The Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto. Written for a Western-style orchestra, it features
			a solo violin played using some Chinese techniques.
